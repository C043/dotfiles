# C043 - NVIM
This is my personal neovim configuration, I started with [Kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and then I tweaked things as I liked them. It's a forever WIP as it changes with me.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository in ~/.config
2. Rename the folder from "c043-nvim" to "nvim"
3. That's it, the next time you will open neovim, it will install and set
   everything automatically!
