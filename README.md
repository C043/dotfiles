# Welcome to my Dotfiles

I discovered this new way to maintain various configuration files in one place
thanks to [bashbunni](https://github.com/bashbunni).

## GNU stow

To install a config from these dotfiles you'll need `GNU stow`. This is a tool
to keep all configuration files in one repository and create symlinks to where
the specific configurations have be located.

This lets you keep all the configuration files you want to save in one place.

Here is an [article](https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html) about it.
